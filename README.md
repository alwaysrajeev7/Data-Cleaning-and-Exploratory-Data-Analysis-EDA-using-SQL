# Laptop Dataset - Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) using SQL

# Introduction
- This project focuses on performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing information about laptops.
- SQL queries are used to explore the dataset, identify data quality issues, and gain insights into the data.

# Dataset
- The dataset contains information about various laptops, including details such as the company, type, screen size, specifications, and price. 
- The dataset is provided in CSV format and includes the following columns:

**Unnamed: 0:** Index column
**Company:** Laptop manufacturer
**TypeName:** Type of laptop (e.g., Ultrabook, Notebook)
**Inches:** Screen size in inches
**ScreenResolution:** Screen resolution
**Cpu:** Processor type and speed
**Ram:** RAM capacity
**Memory:** Storage type and capacity
**Gpu:** Graphics processing unit
**OpSys:** Operating system
**Weight:** Laptop weight
**Price:** Laptop price

# Data Cleaning
- Data cleaning involves preparing the dataset for analysis by addressing data quality issues.
- The following data cleaning tasks are performed using SQL:
- Handling missing values
- Removing duplicates
- Standardizing data formats
- Correcting inconsistencies

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- EDA is performed using SQL queries to gain insights into the dataset and understand its characteristics.
- The following EDA tasks are performed:
- Calculating summary statistics
- Identifying patterns and relationships
